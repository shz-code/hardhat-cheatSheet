# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat node -> npm run node
npx hardhat compile -> npm run compile
npx hardhat run .\scripts\deploy.js -> npm run deploy
npx hardhat test -> npm run test
npx hardhat console
```
